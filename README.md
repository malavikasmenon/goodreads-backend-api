# Project Overview
### Inspiration
You must have seen that one shot repititively used in rom-coms across cultures - the lead characters are in a bookstore/library, coincidentally about to take the same book at the same time. They notice each other suddenly and thus begins the spark of love. In an increasingly digital world, this might be a little hard to achieve, and this project is our humble attempt to recreate this. 

Our Goodreads Dating App is exactly what it sounds like - use your Goodreads logs to match with people. If there are people reading the same books as you are, enjoying the same authors as you are and even have an overlap in your wishlists, chances are you all might have a lot in common to talk about & those conversations could potentially lead to something more. 

### Why Goodreads?
Despite its minimal UI and limited features, it remains one of the most popular tools to log your reads and has considerable number of users on board. 

### User Notes
Since Goodreads don't have an active API set to be used, the public user profiles need to be scraped in order to get your logged information. So, to be able to use the application it is required that users have a public Goodreads profile.
